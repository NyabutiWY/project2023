          Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), belonging to the Lamiaceae family, is an
          annual spicy plant generally utilized as a flavouring agent for food.
          Although basil is indigenous to India, it is cultivated worldwide and
          is particularly appreciated in cuisine for its distinctive aroma
          (given by essential oils). Basil is mainly used as a spice but is also
          considered a main ingredient in certain preparations, such as “Pesto
          Genovese”. (Romano et al,.2022).
